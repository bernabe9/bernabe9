### Hi there, I'm Berna 👋

I’m a Software Engineer with a Computer Science background and 5+ years of web development.

I build software products 🧑🏻‍💻

My passion is coding ❤️ but helping others is what gives me the opportunity to learn something new every day.

I truly believe that perseverance, motivation, and commitment are the keys to make a difference.

I kind of love almost every technical challenge 💻 I’m always looking for the best solution based on the product (I think that a product's vision is as important as technical background) . I have experience working in startups, big projects with larger teams, and open source projects.
